								How many of you get blood donor requests on your phone or on Facebook and still carry on with your day, thinking someone else will volunteer? How many of you see a blood donation van in your vicinity, and cross it without even giving a thought - because who has the time? Now imagine your loved one in desperate need of blood, with his life relying on receiving platelets from a donor. Despite circulating endless messages across your network, you see only 1-2 random walk-ins. Helpless, right?<br><br>Did you know India fell short of 1.9 million units of blood in 2016-17, which is equivalent to 60 tankers. It could have helped in 320,000 heart surgeries or 49,000 organ transplants, reveals official data.<br><br>Every two seconds someone needs blood in India. Delhi-based journo Ankita Shukla's dad was recently diagnosed with a blood infection called Deep Vein Thrombosis with dengue, which is killing his platelets; thus, making it imperative for him to receive blood transfusion every day until the platelets stabilize. The family has been frantically dropping messages to all possible donors. This may have to continue for more days and she is scared every single day if her father will receive the required platelet count. "I spend most of my day arranging for donors. The screening test in itself takes almost 1.5 hours and it feels extremely frustrating when a potential donor fails the test." A man who came to donate blood told her that unless someone has lost someone dear to this situation or have had a family member in such a critical state, they don't understand the seriousness. " Thokar khaake seekhte hai."<br><br>Why you must donate<br>Most people are not aware that not only blood donation help save many lives, regular donation also helps cut down one's risk of cholesterol, cardiac issues and overload of iron in the body. The process also helps you with regular blood screening and purification of blood.<br><br>Challenges<br>Sometimes too much blood is collected at the same time - it makes it highly likely for officials to see the shortage of donors in near future since they won't turn up for a few months at least (according to Red Cross, blood should be donated once in 8 to 12 weeks). Secondly, there could be an excess collection of blood that you may end up wasting.<br><br>It is crucial to create a culture of blood donation where people donate every three months to save lives - because tomorrow it could be you or your loved one!<br><br>
