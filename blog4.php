								Here, wedding venue to turn into a blood donation camp <br><br>
							</h1>
							<p>
								<span>We are here to collaborate with the community to deliver a hope for life by any means</span>

								Certain things make you believe that humanity still exists. They restore one’s faith that people still care about each other. And, make you believe in the fact that there exists a beautiful life beyond all the disheartening cases of theft, burglary and rapes that take place every single day. You must be wondering why we are talking about all this here and what all this has got to do with a wedding?<br><br>Meet the couples who changed the entire concept of ‘wedding gifts’ and took it to a whole new humanitarian level. They asked their guests to bring in no gifts, but instead convinced them to donate blood and their body parts for the needy. A while ago, we shared this heartwarming story of an American couple who held a blood donation camp at their wedding. We feel proud to share about the following families who took humanity to an all new level.<br><br>Dr. R.B Bhesania, who practices in Vadodara, Gujarat, surprised everyone at the wedding with his unbelievable deed when he asked the guests at his daughter’s wedding to donate blood and their body parts. He himself had been spreading awareness about blood and organ donation for years. So, what better opportunity to educate people than at his own daughter’s wedding? While talking about the occasion, he was quoted as saying,<br><br>The idea was to spread awareness about donating blood and organs. A wedding is an auspicious occasion to make people understand the importance of life. My daughter Dhvani and son-in-law Jay Pandya (both doctors) readily agreed to donate their blood on the wedding day. It was the best wedding gift for us.<br><br>The guests were greeted with a red rose each, and the couple of honour kick-started the celebrations by donating their blood first. Dr. Bhesania also stated,     "We had decided not to give any gold or valuables to our daughter. Instead, we asked the couple to take a pledge they would donate their blood and body as well."      The couple also took the pledge that they would not support female foeticide, stay away from tobacco products and encourage others for blood and organ donation.<br><br>This event went on to be registered in the Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records. Not only were 375 bottles of blood collected in this spectacular endeavour.<br><br>
